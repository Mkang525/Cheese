      "[<p>Wine and cheese are well known bedfellows but if you’re a beginner it might seem daunting to decide exactly which wine to choose for which cheese. This guide will quickly help you to get started pairing wine and cheese like a pro. </p>, <p>You might be wondering, should I start with the wine or the cheese? </p>, <p>Most beginners to wine and cheese pairing will be starting with a particular cheese or looking for wines for a cheeseboard. So we’ve broken things down by cheese type. (For wines to pair with your favourite cheese see below)</p>, <p>\n",
      "<img alt=\"\" class=\"\" rel=\"\" src=\"siteimages/Cheese/cheddar-cheese-©-stephanie-frey-at-fotolia.com.jpg\"/> </p>, <p>Hard cheeses include <a href=\"news/pairings/six_of_the_best_matches_for_cheddar_cheese/\">cheddar</a>, <a href=\"news/pairings/the-best-wine-matches-for-comt---updated/\">Comté</a>, Parmigiano-Reggiano and <a href=\"news/pairings/the-best-wine-matches-for-manchego-berkswell-and-other-hard-sheeps-cheeses/\">Manchego</a>. They’re the easiest type of cheese to pair with wine - a medium bodied red like a <em>cabernet sauvignon</em> or a <em>rioja</em> is probably going to be the most enjoyable pairing for most people but try the combination of cheddar and <em>chardonnay</em></p>, <p>Soft cheeses range from spreadable cheeses like Philadelphia to semi-soft white rinded cheeses like <a href=\"news/pairings/5_top_drink_pairings_for_brie/\">brie</a> and <a href=\"news/pairings/what-to-pair-with-camembert/\">camembert</a>. I like them with a fruity red like a <strong>pinot noir</strong> or a <strong>Beaujolais</strong> but rosé works well with this style of cheese too.</p>, <p>\n",
      "<img alt=\"\" class=\"\" rel=\"\" src=\"siteimages/Cheese/blue-cheese.-copyright-kkavve-at-fotolia.com.jpg\"/> </p>, <p>Blue cheeses include <a href=\"news/pairings/8_great_drinks_to_match_with_stilton/\">Stilton</a>, <a href=\"news/pairings/the-best-wine-pairings-with-roquefort-and-a-sensational-whisky-match/\">Roquefort</a> and Gorgonzola. Classic wine pairings tend to be sweet, for example <strong>Sauternes with Roquefort</strong> or <strong>port and stilton</strong>. For something a bit different, try<strong> sloe gin</strong> or <strong>sweet sherry</strong>. And, believe it or not, even <a href=\"news/pairings/8-great-food-pairings-for-stout-and-porter/\">stout and blue cheese</a> work well together.</p>, <p>\n",
      "<img alt=\"\" class=\"\" rel=\"\" src=\"siteimages/Cheese/goat_cheese_wine_pairings.jpg\"/></p>, <p><strong>Sauvignon blanc</strong> is the classic wine pairing for <a href=\"news/pairings/top-wine-pairings-with-goats-cheese-chvre/\">goat cheese</a>, but you could also try a crisp dry <strong>Provençal rosé</strong> (particularly for a summer picnic) or a fresh fruity red such as <strong>Beaujolais</strong>. </p>, <p>\n",
      "<img alt=\"Copyright hawanafsu at fotolia.com\" class=\"\" rel=\"\" src=\"siteimages/Cheese/epoisses.-copyright-hawanafsu-at-fotolia.com.jpg\"/> </p>, <p>Washed-Rind cheeses - often referred to as ‘stinky cheese’ - include Epoisses, Reblochon, <a href=\"cmsplus/blogs.php?pagename=pairings&amp;entry=11415\">Vacherin Mont d’Or </a>and <a href=\"news/blog/5-of-the-worlds-sexiest-cheeses/\">Taleggio</a>. They tend to be quite pungent especially as they mature so don’t expect anything great in the way of a wine pairing. Oddly a crisp dry white wine - or a strong Belgian-style ale - can work better than a red</p>, <p>\n",
      "<img alt=\"© tsuboya at fotolia.com\" class=\"\" rel=\"\" src=\"siteimages/Cheese/cheese-fondue-©tsuboya.jpg\"/></p>, <p>It’s not a cheese style in its own right but melted cheese classics such as fondue and raclette deserve a mention. They aren’t the easiest dishes to match, but a good bet is a crisp or aromatic white wine from the region where these dishes are popular. You’ll find some specific suggestions in this post: <a href=\"news/blog/5-of-the-worlds-sexiest-cheeses/\">the best wine pairings with cheese fondue, raclette and tartiflette.</a></p>, <p>Most people like to pair red wine with cheese and that’s fine - just bear in mind that there are some cheeses, as I’ve suggested above, that taste better with a white wine or dessert wine so don't be afraid to experiment.</p>, <p>\n",
      "<img alt=\"Copyright W Production at fotolia.com\" class=\"\" rel=\"\" src=\"siteimages/Cheese/wine-with-cheese.-copyright-w-production-at-fotolia.com.jpg\"/></p>, <p>1. Cabernet sauvignon, merlot and Bordeaux blends - cheddar, gouda and other hard cheeses</p>, <p>2. Pinot noir - brie and camembert</p>, <p>3.  Rhône and other southern French reds - a good all-rounder with a French cheeseboard</p>, <p>4. Rioja - particularly good with sheep cheeses like Manchego</p>, <p>5.  Chianti - parmigiano reggiano and pecorino</p>, <p>6. Port - blue cheeses like stilton</p>, <p>7. Sauvignon blanc - goat cheese and feta, cheeses with garlic and herbs</p>, <p>8. Chardonnay - buttery cheddar</p>, <p>9. Pinot Grigio  - mozzarella and other mild Italian cheeses (good with an antipasti platter)</p>, <p>10. Champagne and other sparkling wine - Vacherin Mont d’or, Chaource</p>, <p><strong>If you enjoyed this post download my cheese book <a href=\"shop/101-great-ways-to-enjoy-cheese-and-wine/\">101 Great Ways to Enjoy Cheese and Wine</a> for loads of (well, over 101!) other pairing ideas </strong></p>, <p>Top photo ©  <a href=\"https://en.fotolia.com/p/200376827\" target=\"_blank\">George Dolgikh</a> at fotolia.com</p>, <p><em>If you found this post useful and were happy to get the advice for free perhaps you'd think about donating towards the running costs of the site?
